# Language Model

Language Model is a computer program that analyze a given sequence of words and provide a basis for their word prediction. Language model is used in AI, NLP, NLU, NLG system, particularly ones that perform text generation, machine translation and question answering.

## LLM - Large Language Model 
LLM are are designed to understand and generate human language at scale. **GPT**, **BERT**.

## Masked Language Model
MLM are a specific type of language model that predicts masked or hidden or blank words in a sentence.

## Casual Language Model
CLM generate text sequentially, one token at a time, based only on the tokens that came before it in the input sequence. It basically predict next word based on previous word

# Large Language Model
Large language model is a machine learning model designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language on a vast scale. These models are typically built using deep learning techniques, especially variants of the transformer architecture, and are trained on massive datasets of text from the internet and other sources.

# Generative AI
Generative AI refers to deep-learning models that can generate high-quality text, images, and other content based on the data they were trained on.
